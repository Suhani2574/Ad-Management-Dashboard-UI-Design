# Frontend-Website-Design-
The project is designed as a modern AI SaaS web interface AI ads manager platforms . The primary focus was on clean UI, smooth user experience, and modular structure. The project uses HTML + Tailwind CSS, allowing faster development and consistent styling through utility classes.
🔹 Design Decisions
A dark-themed UI with gradient backgrounds (indigo–purple) was chosen to give a premium, AI-focused look.Floating animated words were added in the background using CSS animations to create a dynamic and futuristic feel without affecting usability.
The layout follows a minimal and centered design, keeping user attention on the main interaction area.
Action buttons and cards use rounded edges and soft shadows, improving visual hierarchy and accessibility.
Icons and small emojis (Meta, Amazon, LinkedIn, Perplexity) are used to make interactions intuitive and recognizable.

🔹 Structural Decisions
The project uses HTML + Tailwind CSS, allowing faster development and consistent styling through utility classes.CSS animations are kept separate and reusable to maintain clean structure and performance.
The code is written in a component-like structure, making it easy to scale or convert into React or another framework later.
Responsiveness is handled using Tailwind’s flex and spacing utilities, ensuring compatibility across devices.
